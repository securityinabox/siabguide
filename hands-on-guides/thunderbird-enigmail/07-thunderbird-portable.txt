# Portable Thunderbird with GPG and Enigmail

**Mozilla Thunderbird** is a free and open source email client for receiving, sending and storing emails. You can manage multiple email accounts through a single program. **Enigmail** and **GnuPG** will give you access to authentication, digital signing and encryption to ensure the privacy and security of your email communication.

## Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Thunderbird

The essential benefit of using **Portable Thunderbird** is that you may store local copies of your emails on the removable drive or USB memory stick. In addition to this, both the **Portable Thunderbird** program itself, as well as all local copies of your emails, can be concealed within a **TrueCrypt** encrypted volume. As such, you improve the security of your emails and conceal your email accounts and addresses you use. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.

**Note**: To maintain the privacy and your security of your email communications, you are strongly recommended to download and extract **GnuPG Portable** as outlined at the end of this page.
