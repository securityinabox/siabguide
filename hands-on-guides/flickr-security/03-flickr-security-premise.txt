# Social networking platforms

These social networking security guides aim to help you navigate the privacy and security settings of a few popular social networking platforms, with a view toward making them more secure (though less insecure is perhaps a better way of putting it). Specifically, step-by step guides are provided for Facebook and Twitter, and some general guidelines are provided for YouTube and Flickr.

These social networking websites are the most popular and widely used social networking tools. They are owned by private companies and, as noted in chapter [**9. How to protect yourself and your data when using social networking sites**](https://siabnext.ttc.io/en/chapter-9), these companies make their money by collecting information about users and selling it on to advertisers.

Government crackdowns will target these sites first and block them, and the companies will cave into government pressures and censor when necessary. If they are not blocked, they are actively monitored by numerous governments who collect user metadata and make requests for private information about individuals of interest, often including human rights defenders. Note, in this regard, that companies managing social networking servers have access to **all your information**, including your private data and password.

It may be worth looking at alternatives to these sites, such as [**Diaspora**](http://joindiaspora.com/), [**Crabgrass**](https://securityinabox.org/en/context/01/crabgrass-online-collaboration), [**Friendica**](http://friendica.com/), [**Pidder**](https://pidder.com/), or [**SecureShare**](http://secushare.org/) which have been designed with digital security and activism in mind. The [**Social Swarm**](http://socialswarm.net/) is a think-tank run by a not-for-profit organisation which carries out discussions, awareness-raising and campaigns related to privacy on social networks, and may be a useful learning resource.

Other similar sites may be popular in different regions, so you way wish to explore other options. Before choosing one you should consider the following points:

1. Does it provide connection over **SSL** (like http*s*) for all uses of the site, rather than just during login? Are there no problems related to encryption, such as problems related to encryption certificates?
2. Read the End User Licence Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully. How are your content and personal data treated? With whom are they shared? For a useful add-on which helps users undestand the Terms of Service of many popular sites, see [**Terms of Service; Didn't Read**](http://tosdr.org/)
3. What privacy options are provided for users? Can you choose to share your videos securely with a small number of individuals, or are they all public by default?
4. Do you know the **geographical location of the servers**, under which territorial jurisdiction they fall or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information? Will the site's owners hand over information if they receive a governmental request to do so?

## Things you should know about Flickr before you start

**Flickr** is owned by Yahoo! and also facilitates integration with other accounts including Google and Facebook. Content posted on **Flickr** remains yours, to which you can attribute different creative commons licenses or copyright. You are giving Yahoo! a license to distribute your photos or videos by submitting content. Because of the diverse licensing attribution, **Flickr** is great both for finding pictures to be used in campaigns and as a resource for sharing images with colleagues, allies and members of your networks. However,  it's highly likely that **Flickr** user data is gathered and monitored by a number of governments.

For more information, read on Yahoo!'s [**Privacy Policy**](http://privacy.yahoo.com).
