# Additional tips on improving your email security

- Always use caution when opening email attachments that you are not expecting, that come from someone you do not know or that contain suspicious subject lines. When opening emails like this, you should ensure that your anti-virus software is up-to-date and pay close attention to any warnings displayed by your browser or email program.
- Using anonymity software like [*Tor*](/en/glossary#Tor), which is described in [***Chapter 8: How to remain anonymous and bypass censorship on the Internet***](/en/chapter-8), can help you hide your chosen email service from anyone who might be monitoring your Internet connection. And, depending on the extent of Internet filtering in your country, you may need to use [*Tor*](/en/glossary#Tor), or one of the other [*circumvention*](/en/glossary#Circumvention)  tools described in [***chapter 8***](/en/chapter-8), just to access a secure email provider such as [*RiseUp*](/en/glossary#RiseUp) or Gmail.
- When creating an account that you intend to use while remaining anonymous from your own email recipients, or from public forums to which you might post messages by email, you must be careful not to register a username or 'Full Name' that is related to your personal or professional life. In such cases, it is also important that you avoid using Hotmail, Yahoo, or any other webmail provider that includes your[*IP address*](/en/glossary#IP_address) in the messages you send.
- Depending on who might have physical access to your computer, clearing email-related traces from your temporary files might be just as important as protecting your messages as they travel across the Internet. See [***Chapter 6: How to destroy sensitive information***](/en/chapter-6) and the [***CCleaner Guide***](/en/ccleaner_main) for details.
- You may consider using several different, anonymous email accounts for communicating with different groups of people to protect of your contact network. You may also use different email accounts for signing up to Internet services which require email accounts.
- After all above precautions it is still very important to beware of what you write in the messages and what impact would it have if it fell into the wrong hands. One way of increasing the security of information exchange is to develope a code system for sensitive information exchange, so you would not use real names of the people, real addresses of places, etc.

# Tips on responding to suspected email hacking and surveillance

**If you suspect your email account has been hacked or compromised**, you can take steps to reduce the damage done. While it is difficult to be certain, there may be clues such as:

- you notice any changes to your email account content or settings that you didn't make;
- your email contacts notify you that they have received an email that you didn't send;
- you cannot login to your email account, though you are sure your password and other settings are correct; 
- you are regularly not receiving some email messages from your colleagues that they insist that they sent to you; 
- some private information that was sent or received exclusively by email was made known to a third party, though neither you nor your correspondent shared it with anyone else;
- if on your account activity log (if your email provider offers one) you see that your account was accessed at time that you do not remember or from a place (or IP address) that you did not go to.

In such situations you may want to take some cautionary action:

- **Stop using this email account for sensitive information exchange**, at least until you understand the situation better.

- **Change your password as soon as possible**. See [***Chapter 3 to know how to create and maintain secure passwords***](/en/chapter-3). In order to be able to change the password for your account (or for other accounts) you need to become familiar with how you do this on your email system, so that when you need to, you can do so quickly. **Change password for all other accounts with the same or similar passwords** as they may also be compromised. Use different and strong passwords for each account. You may also want to change passwords for all other accounts that you have. Consider using [**KeePass**](/en/keepass_main) to store and manage all your passwords. **Change your security question answers** (if you use them) for all accounts, so they are impossible to guess, or find the answer through researching information about you. This is a precaution in the case your computer was infected with spyware which would then put your other accounts at risk.

- **If you are not able to log in** to your account to change the passwords, consider getting in contact with your email provider to try to reclaim your account. Some email providers have special procedures in place to help users in such situation. It is helpful to know these procedures ahead of time.

- **Mitigate information loss and impact** to your community. It is important to make a response plan. Knowing what sensitive kinds of information you had in your account and determining the persons with whom you exchange information via that account, decide whom you should alert and what other accounts you will have to revisit or close. Determine what services (web, financial, etc.) you need to revisit or cancel. It is important that you **check the folders of your account** (if you can) to research on what could have been sent from your account and to act accordingly. To **inform your contacts** you will need to keep a separate backup of your address book. Also **review your account settings** to see possible changes that has been made. Check accounts signature option for links and malware, forwarding options that would allow to copy emails that you receive to third account, away message, display name, etc.

- **Research how your account was compromised.** Was it because of having a weak password, or due to malware infection, etc. The more you will establish about this, the better you will be able to respond to the situation and better you will be able to protect your contacts.

- **Review security of all of your devices** that access emails from this account, and devices on which you stored the password to this email account. See chapters [1. How to protect your computer from malware and hackers](/en/chapter-1), [2. How to protect your information from physical threats](/en/chapter-2) and [11. How to use smartphones as securely as possible](/en/chapter-11). Review your anti-virus software (see the [Avast! - Anti-Virus](/en/avast_main) and [Spybot - Anti-Spyware](/en/spybot_main) hands-on guides). Scan your computer: read [4.1 A Short Guide to Dealing with Virus Outbreaks](/en/dealingwithviruses#4.1). Use a rescue CD or USB to do a thorough scan - read [4.9 Advanced Virus Removal Methods](/en/dealingwithviruses#4.9). If you are not certain that you are able to clean your device, consider reinstalling all software including the operating system from a clean source. Consider switching to more secure programs like [Firefox](/en/firefox_main), [Thunderbird](/en/thunderbird_main), [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) and other [Free and Open Source Programs](/en/glossary#FOSS). After making the above improvements to the security of your devices, change your account passwords again to new, stronger ones.

- Consider reporting hacking of your account to your email provider.

- Consider using another, more secure account, e.g. one that notifies you of and prevent access from unusual places or devices. Consider using account that is hosted outside of your country. Consider using email encryption - read [gpg4usb - email text and files encryption](/en/gpg4usb_portable) or [Thunderbird with Enigmail and GPG - Secure Email Client](/en/thunderbird_main). 

- Consider avoiding storing read emails on the email server in your email account. Instead download them to your secured computer. Analyse security of the way you access your account and devices that you use for this.

It is important that you act quickly and precisely in the situation like this. Having prepared and rehearsed plan may help you.


**If you suspect that someone is already monitoring your email**, you may want to create a new account and keep the old one as a decoy. Remember, though, that any account with which you have exchanged email in the past may now be under surveillance as well. As a result, you should observe some additional precautions:

- Both you and your recent email contacts should create new accounts and connect to them only from locations, such as Internet cafes, that you have never used before. We recommend this strategy in order to prevent connections from your usual computer, which may be monitored, from giving away the location of your new account. As an alternative, if you must login to your new account from your normal location, you can use one of the tools described in [***Chapter 8: How to remain anonymous and bypass censorship on the Internet***](/en/chapter-8), to hide these connections.
- Exchange information about these new email addresses only through secure channels, such as a face-to-face meetings, secure instant messages or encrypted [*VoIP*](/en/glossary#VoIP) conversations. 
- Keep the traffic on your old account mostly unchanged, at least for a while. It should appear to the eavesdropper as if you are still using that account for sensitive communication. Presumably, you will want to avoid revealing critical information, but you should try not to make it obvious that you are doing so. As you can imagine, this may be somewhat challenging. 
- Make it difficult to link your actual identity to your new account. Do not send email between the new account and your old accounts (or the accounts of any contacts whom you think may also be monitored). 
- Be aware of what you write when using your new account. It is best to avoid using real names and addresses or phrases like 'human rights' or 'torture.' Develop an informal code system with your email contacts and change it periodically. 
- Remember, email security is not just about having strong technical defences. It is about paying attention to how you and your email contacts communicate with each other, and about remaining disciplined in your non-technical security habits.
